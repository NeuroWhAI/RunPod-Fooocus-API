# RunPod-Fooocus-API

This repository consists of two branches:
[NetworkVolume](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/tree/NetworkVolume) and [Standalone](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/tree/Standalone)

The **NetworkVolume** expects you to install and prepare your own `Fooocus-API v0.3.30` instance on the RunPod network volume, or to use our `3wad/runpod-fooocus-api:0.3.30-networksetup` image. This is ideal if you want to change models, loras or other contents on the fly. The downside of this solution is slower starts, especially when the endpoint is not used frequently. See [network-guide](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/blob/NetworkVolume/docs/network-guide.md) for step by step instructions.

The **Standalone** branch is ready-to-use docker image with all the files and models already baked and installed into it. You can still customize it to use your own contents, but they can't be changed without rebuilding and redeploying the image. This is ideal if you want the fastest, cheapest possible endpoint for long-term usage without needs for frequent changes of models or loras. See [standalone-guide](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/blob/NetworkVolume/docs/standalone-guide.md) or simply use `3WaD/RunPod-Fooocus-API:v0.3.30-standalone` as the image for a quick "default" deploy on your RunPod serverless endpoint.

## How to send requests
[request_examples.js](https://github.com/davefojtik/RunPod-Fooocus-API/blob/NetworkVolume/docs/request_examples.js) contain example payloads for all endpoints on your serverless worker, regardless of the branch. But don't hesitate to ask if you need more help.

## Contributors Welcomed
Feel free to do pull requests, fixes, improvements and suggestions to the code. I can spend only limited time on this as it's a side project for our community discord bot. So any cooperation will help manage this repo better.

## Updates
The version of compatible Fooocus-API is always stated on the top of this readme. We're not always on the latest version automatically, as there can be breaking changes. The updates are being made only after troughrough tests on our community discord bot.
